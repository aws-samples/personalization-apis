# Personalization APIs Configuration

The Personalization APIs solution operates based on a hosted configuration stored in [AWS AppConfig](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/appconfig/). The configuration is specified in a hosted JSON profile in AppConfig and includes all of the settings that control the APIs' behavior. Within the configuration you can setup one or more namespaces (analagous to an application, a Personalize domain, or a Personalize custom dataset group).

At deployment time, you can have the project automatically generate a configuration based the recommenders, campaigns, and event trackers in one or more Amazon Personalize dataset groups in your AWS environment. This is a great way to save time setting up the foundation of your configuration. You can then take this base configuration and customize it further to suit your needs.

## OpenAPI/Swagger specification

Each time the application [configuration](./configuration.md) is deployed in AppConfig, the solution will generate an [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://www.openapis.org/) specification file based the configuration. The OpenAPI specification file is written to the `/openapi` folder in the staging bucket created as part of this project. You can use this specification file to test your APIs using a utility such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) tool as well as generating clients for your APIs in a variety of programming languages.

## Primary concepts

- **Configuration** - there is a single configuration definition that is represented in JSON and stored as a hosted configuration profile in AWS AppConfig. A configuration can be automatically generated at deployment based on Amazon Personalize resources already in your account. Otherwise, a skeleton configuration is created that you can quickly update to match your environment.
- **Namespace** - a logical construct within the configuration that can be used to organize recommenders at an application or dataset group level. One or more namespaces can be defined in the configuration.
- **Recommender** - a logical provider of recommendations for a specific use case within a namespace. One or more recommenders can be defined for a namespace.
- **Variation** - the definition for an actual implementation of a recommender. One or more variations can be defined for a recommender. For example, multiple variations are used with A/B tests.
- **Event target** - a destination or sink for events/interactions that are streamed to the events entry point for a namespace. One or more event targets can be defined for a namespace.

### Namespace

A logical construct within the configuration that can be used to organize recommenders at an application or dataset group level. One or more namespaces can be defined in the configuration.

Here is an example of a configuration that defines three different applications as separate namespaces. The keys within `namespace` uniquely identify each namespace where the key value is used to map an API request to a namespace. See the [API entry points](./api_entry_points.md) documentation for details on API URI mapping to namespaces and recommenders.

```json
{
    "namespaces": {
        "my-app-1": {
        },
        "my-app-2": {
        },
        "my-app-3": {
        }
    }
}
```

### Recommender

A logical provider of recommendations for a specific use case within a namespace. One or more recommenders can be defined for a namespace.

Here is an example of a single namespace configuration for `my-app-1` that has three recommenders defined for all three supported API action types (`recommend-items`, `related-items`, and `rerank-items`). Under each API action type, one or more recommenders can be defined where the key uniquely identifies the recommender within the namespace. You define this key and it is used to map API requests to a recommender. See the [API entry points](./api_entry_points.md) documentation for details on API URI mapping to namespaces and recommenders.

```json
{
    "namespaces": {
        "my-app-1": {
            "recommenders": {
                "recommend-items": {
                    "my-recommended-for-you": {
                    }
                },
                "related-items": {
                    "my-similar": {
                    }
                },
                "rerank-items": {
                    "my-personalized-ranking": {
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Variation

The definition for an actual implementation of a recommender. One or more variations can be defined for a recommender. Multiple variations are used with A/B tests.

Here is an example of a single namespace configuration for `my-app-1` that has a single `recommend-items` recommender with the key `my-recommended-for-you`. This recommender has a single variation with the key `my-user-personalization` that is a Personalize campaign.

```json
{
    "namespaces": {
        "my-app-1": {
            "recommenders": {
                "recommend-items": {
                    "my-recommended-for-you": {
                        "variations": {
                            "my-user-personalization": {
                                "type": "personalize-campaign",
                                "arn": "arn:aws:personalize:[REGION]:[ACCOUNT]:campaign/[CAMPAIGN_NAME]"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    "namespaces": {
        "my-app-1": {
            "recommenders": {
                "recommend-items": {

                                "type": "personalize-campaign",
                                "arn": "arn:aws:personalize:[REGION]:[ACCOUNT]:campaign/[CAMPAIGN_NAME]",
                                "filters": [{
                                    "arn": "arn:aws:personalize:[REGION]:[ACCOUNT]:filter/[FILTER_NAME]"
                                }]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.recommender.{ACTION_TYPE}.{RECOMMENDER_KEY}.variations.{VARIATION_KEY}.filters[].condition`: Identifies pre-condition for using this filter (optional). The currently supported value for this field is `"user-required"` indicating that a user is required for the filter. In this case, if a user is not specified on the request, the filter will not be used.
- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.recommender.{ACTION_TYPE}.{RECOMMENDER_KEY}.variations.{VARIATION_KEY}.filters[].autoDynamicFilterValues`: Automatically generated dynamic filter parameter values using context (optional). See the [automatic context](./auto_context.md) documentation for details.

### Event targets

Destinations or sinks for events/interactions that are streamed to the events entry point for a namespace. One or more event targets can be defined for a namespace. This configuration is quite flexible. You can have the Personalization APIs solution send events directly to multiple event targets or you can setup a Kinesis data stream as a single event target and then build/configure consumers on that Kinesis stream in Kinesis to fan out events from there.

Here is an example of a namespace that has a single event target that is a Personalize event tracker.

```json
{
   "namespaces": {
        "my-app-1": {
            "eventTargets": [
                {
                    "type": "personalize-event-tracker",
                    "trackingId": "[TRACKING_ID]"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Amazon Personalize Event Tracker

Note: Only events are sent to event trackers. Experiment conversion events are not sent to Personalize since it does not support them.

- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].type`: Must be `"personalize-event-tracker"`
- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].trackingId`: The Amazon Personalize Event Tracker tracking ID.

#### Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].type`: Must be `"kinesis-stream"`
- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].streamName`: The Amazon Kinesis data stream stream name.

#### Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].type`: Must be `"kinesis-firehose"`
- `namespaces.{NAMESPACE_KEY}.eventTargets[].streamName`: The Amazon Kinesis firehose stream name.

### Cache control

Controls how the Personalization APIs manage caching. The `cacheControl` element can be defined at multiple levels to create an inheritance effect. For example, create a top-level `cacheControl` that defines default caching that should be used across all namespaces. If you want to define different cache control at the recommender level, you can add another `cacheControl` element at the recommender level.

```json
{
    "cacheControl": {
        "autoProvision": true,
        "userSpecified": {
            "maxAge": 10,
            "directives": "private"
        },
        "syntheticUserSpecified": {
            "maxAge": 300,
            "directives": "public"
        },
        "noUserSpecified": {
            "maxAge": 1200,
            "directives": "public"
        }
    },
    "namespaces": {
    }
}
```

- `cacheControl.autoProvision`: boolean field that controls whether the Personalization APIs should auto provision/configure cache settings within CloudFront and API Gateway when the configuration changes.
- `cacheControl.userSpecified.maxAge`: integer field that controls the maximum number of seconds (TTL) that responses should be cached when a user has been specified on the request.
- `cacheControl.userSpecified.directives`: [HTTP CacheControl cache directives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) to include in the `Cache-Control` response header for user specific requests.
- `cacheControl.syntheticUserSpecified.maxAge`: integer field that controls the maximum number of seconds (TTL) that responses should be cached when a synthetic user has been specified on the request. Synthetic user IDs represent a logical group/cohort of users such as marketing leads for a marketing campaign.
- `cacheControl.syntheticUserSpecified.directives`: [HTTP CacheControl cache directives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) to include in the `Cache-Control` response header for synthetic user specific requests.
- `cacheControl.noUserSpecified.maxAge`: integer field that controls the maximum number of seconds (TTL) that responses should be cached when a user has **NOT** been specified on the request. For example, for related item recommenders, a userId is not required. These responses can be cached more aggressively, such as in public shared caches, than user-specific responses.
- `cacheControl.noUserSpecified.directives`: [HTTP CacheControl cache directives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) to include in the `Cache-Control` response header for non-user specific requests.

### Item metadata

See the [item metadata](./item_metadata.md) documentation for details.

## How configuration concepts map to API entry points

API entry points are grouped into inference entry points (entry points that provide recommendations) and entry points for managing data used by the recommenders.

## Deploying configurations

The process of deploying your configuration involves building your configuration JSON according to the documentation on this page. Once your JSON is ready, you can deploy it to the Personalization APIs by updating the hosted configuration in AppConfig. This can be done programmatically using the AWS AppConfig SDK/CLI or in the AWS console.

![AppConfig Deploy](../images/config-create.png)

Once deployment has been initiated, the Personalization APIs deployed Lambda functions will pick up the new configuration within 45 seconds. You can identify that the new configuration is being used by inspecting the `X-Personalization-Config-Version` response header. This header's value echoes the `version` field value from the configuration.

```json
{
    "version": "10",
    "namespaces": {

    }
}
```

For the above configuration, every API response will have a response header like this:

`X-Personalization-Config-Version: 10`

By changing the version in your configuration each time you make a change, you can verify that it has been deployed by checking this response header.

If you are using the Swagger UI to test and inspect your APIs, you will also see the version displayed at the stop of the Swagger page.

### Configuration caching

The Personalization APIs Lambda function uses the [AWS AppConfig Lambda extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions.html) to access the configuration. You can control how often the extension polls AppConfig for configuration changes via the `AWS_APPCONFIG_EXTENSION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable. The default is every 45 seconds. To change the polling interval, add/change the `AWS_APPCONFIG_EXTENSION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable **on the Personalization APIs lambda function**. You can find the ARN for this function in the CloudFormation output parameters when you deployed the solution or by searching for the function in the AWS console for Lambda.
